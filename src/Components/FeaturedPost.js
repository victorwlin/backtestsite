              Unusual Whales: Developing a Trading Strategy, Part 1

              Unusual Whales is a trading tool that alerts you when large trades
              are being made in the market. The idea being that there are hedge
              funds and other big players out there who might have more
              information than everyone else, and it might pay to follow these
              whales into their positions. The tool does a bunch of different
              types of alerts, but for this series, Iâ€™m going to be focusing
              exclusively on options.
